# Interactive AI Portfolio 🤖✨  

**Static portfolios are outdated.**  
So I built an interactive portfolio with AI.

Instead of making you scroll endlessly, my portfolio adapts to *you*.  
Ask a question — my AI avatar replies instantly.

## 👇 What can you ask?

- 🧠 **Tech recruiter?** Ask about my analytics skills & results  
- 💻 **Fellow analyst?** Dive into my data projects & mindset  
- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 **Potential collaborator?** See what I've been working on  

---

This is not a portfolio.  
It's a **conversation tailored to your curiosity**.

*What will you ask?*
